9,19644,19644,"Interesting how it compares to the actual country specific trend. I'm guessing that China's search traffic is so huge that even with this much of a drop off from their original spike they still show up at the top with a 100 compared to other countries - idk how the weighting here actually works though so...

That drop off is most likely due to government and app(e.g. WeChat) specific bans on AI / ChatGPT specifically.

Israel(light blue line) on the other hand is at a new high - Nepal's chart wasn't as interesting, though they are also trending up.

Is there any way to compare country results within Google Trends? I had to overlay screenshots for the comparison.

What I’m saying is, it’s a tool, and when used responsibly, can be incredibly helpful.

EDIT to add: this wasn’t a basic book report paper. It was a graduate nursing paper on a pretty niche thing.

15,38504,2761,"I'm pretty sure that chess players are still doing fine, even though chess is ""solved"" by AI. It's really not a strong argument - chess engines passed human potential in the late 90s and there have literally never been more people playing chess, both professionally and on an amateur basis.

The same thing is likely to happen in other areas - we understand that the AI is there if we need a superior quality product, one that values perfection over everything else, but if what we value is the human qualities of it, then we'll choose those as appropriate. The sort of work that AI kills is the drudgery, not the inspired top quality.

I'm a potter, and there's no way I can compete with industrial slipcast production, it's so far above and beyond what an individual can do that it's laughable. But there are qualities to the work that I produce that are different and desirable in their own right, qualities that are inherent in the flawed and manual nature of the production process I use.

Obviously there are a lot of industries that collapsed when industrialization took over - you don't see a lot of hand tailored clothing any more, for example - but that doesn't mean that writing as an occupation is going to be obsolete.",r/technology,pretty sure chess player fine chess solve ai strong argument chess engine pass human potential late literally people play chess professionally amateur basis thing likely happen area understand ai need superior quality product value perfection value human quality choose appropriate sort work ai kill drudgery inspired quality potter way compete industrial slipcast production far individual laughable quality work produce different desirable right quality inherent flawed manual nature production process use obviously lot industry collapse industrialization take lot hand tailor clothing example mean write occupation go obsolete,0,4,subcluster
